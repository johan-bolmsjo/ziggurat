#+title: Ziggurat TODO List

* Testing
** Remove use of std.debug.panic in tests

Use std.testing.expectEqual or similar construct. Tests return errors in Zig
0.8.x so all test results should be reported that way to present a backtrace on
failures.

* Features
** AVL Tree
*** Add iterator support

* Bugs
** AVL Tree
*** The clear function leaves the tree in a semi destructed state when an error is returned

Commit 8ccf662 made it possible for clear to report an error to support
propagating a testing error reported by the relase function. However this would
leave the tree in a semi destructed state.
