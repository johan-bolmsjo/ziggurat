#+title: Ziggurat TODO List

* TODO Remove use of std.debug.panic in tests
Use std.testing.expectEqual or similar construct. Tests return errors in Zig
0.8.x so all test results should be reported that way to present a backtrace on
failures.

* avl_tree.zig
*** TODO Add iterator support
*** DONE The clear function leaves the tree in a semi destructed state when an error is returned

- CLOSING NOTE [2022-05-23 Mon 15:06] \\
  Reverted API changes introduced by 8ccf662.
  
  There is a remaining issue with testing in general since Zig changed the test
  strategy to have tests return errors instead of panicking.
  
  For example the clear function of the AVL tree may not fail. Doing so would
  leave the tree in an inconsistent state. A test on the other hand may want to
  test that for example the clear callback is invoked the expected number of
  times. With the strategy of returning errors from the test functions, this
  require modifying the real code in ways that are not always suitable.
  
  For the time being I have opted to keep the panics in the test code even though
  it results in very obtuse failure messages. This needs more pondering.
:END:
Commit 8ccf662 made it possible for clear to report an error to support
propagating a testing error reported by the relase function. However this would
leave the tree in a semi destructed state.
